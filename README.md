# 🌌 Exoplanet Detection using Machine Learning

Welcome to the repository for our Machine Learning-based **Exoplanet Detection System**, developed to classify celestial bodies using real-world astronomical data. This project harnesses supervised learning algorithms to distinguish between confirmed exoplanets and non-planetary candidates based on features from the [NASA Exoplanet Archive](https://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu/).

## 🧠 Project Description

This project aims to automate the detection of exoplanets using publicly available datasets. It employs classification algorithms to analyze planetary and stellar characteristics such as:
- Orbital period
- Planetary radius
- Stellar radius
- Effective temperature

After preprocessing and training multiple models, the **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** algorithm was selected for its interpretability and strong performance on numerical data.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Classify whether a given object is a confirmed exoplanet.
- Utilize real data from NASA for training and evaluation.
- Build an intuitive front-end interface for public engagement using Streamlit.

---

## 🚀 Features

- Cleaned and preprocessed exoplanet dataset
- Machine Learning model (KNN) for classification
- Data visualization using Plotly
- Web deployment with Streamlit for live interaction
- Lottie animations for enhanced user experience

---

## 🗃️ Dataset

The dataset is obtained from the **[NASA Exoplanet Archive](https://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu/)**, a science-driven, peer-reviewed repository containing thousands of confirmed and candidate exoplanet entries. The dataset includes features relevant for machine learning such as:
- `pl_orbper` (orbital period)
- `pl_rade` (planet radius in Earth radii)
- `st_rad` (stellar radius)
- `st_teff` (stellar effective temperature)
- `pl_letter` (planet name/classification)

---

## 📊 Model Used

- **Algorithm:** K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- **Libraries:** `pandas`, `numpy`, `sklearn`, `plotly`, `streamlit`
